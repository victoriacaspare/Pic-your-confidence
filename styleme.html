<p>Your style is of course an evolution and will change over time depending on
   various factors relating to your lifestyle. However, being clear on who you want
    to present to the world is something that is unlikely to be drastically different
    no matter what stage of life you’re in. Now that you’ve discovered your colours and understand and
  love your body shape the final step before building your wardrobe is to find your personal style.</p>

  <p>When dressing for the office, it’s important to feel comfortable as you’ll be wearing these clothes all day. Therefore,
     pants often make a good choice as they’re typically easier to move and sit down in than fitted dresses and skirts.
     If you’ve been in your job a while, you’ll have a better understanding of what works for your office. As such,
      you can inject personality into your wardrobe without worrying about appearing underdressed.To nail the look, keep your outfit conservative and flattering.
      A slim-cut navy suit with a white shirt and heels makes a particularly great option. Don’t forget about accessories either. Select minimal jewellery and opt for a
      structured black handbag.
      You can also try tailoring your look to match the job and office that you’re applying to.</p>

    accurate when it comes to replicating the styles of the ’40s through ’60s,
    and despite the shop name, the stuff is totally appropriate for work, too.</p>

  <p>vintage and skate-brand shirts are the most popular among skaters. You can wear a faded t-shirt, a fitted shirt, or even a tank top. Consider wearing a fitted top if you are wearing baggy pants.
    Loose-fitting cargos are another popular choice. They are tomboyish, and the extra pockets are great for storing things, such as music players.
    Capris are another popular choice, especially if they are loose fitting and baggy. Think guy shorts.
Avoid wearing anything that is too ripped or torn looking. It will just look messy</p>

  It's hip to be square this season, because every designer is cashing in on this shape of shoe. We've seen versions of this '90s style over the years,
  but the newest versions are somehow... square-ier? </p>

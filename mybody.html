  <h3>Surround yourself with people that are positive and appreciate you for who you are and not because of how you look. Avoid comparing yourself to other people and don’t compare yourself to a past version of yourself. You are uniquely beautiful right now at this moment and that’s something no one can take from you.
  </p>
  <p>Pamper yourself once in awhile by going out for a manicure, having a bubble bath, going out for a run, or taking a long nap just to make your body feel better. Listening to a powerful song or a song that makes you feel good about yourself. A powerful song gives you motivation and uplifts your spirits.</h3>

    <p>If you ever encounter any problems find solutions to them instead of complaining about them. When you complain about your problems you don’t get anything productive done but by problem solving you’ll feel more accomplished. Smile!!! It’s so helpful when you’re meeting people for the first time and need to give off a good first impression.</p>

    <p>Don’t drown yourself in fear. If you’re scared, one thing you can do to decrease your fear about something is to be willing to take risks, learning to be vulnerable, and feeling comfortable with it. Always face your fears, never run away from them. Learn how to stand up for yourself. This is this quote from Louis Tomlinson and he says “ If you want something, go for it because you got nothing to lose”. He’s right because just because you have an idea and someone shoots it down, it doesn’t mean you can’t pursue it, Just do it. =P The superman pose: If you’re feeling nervous, anxious, or lacking confidence just go into a secluded area and do this pose. Many women have said that this pose helped them overcome their anxiety before a huge event and made them feel better about themselves in general.</p>

    <p> Exercise!!! But not because you want to look better. Exercise to make yourself feel better. When you exercise your body releases more endorphins and makes you feel positive and satisfied after a hard workout. You can get yourself a pet. Pets will never judge you and they will always make you feel loved and special.</p>

      <center>If you have a goal you want to achieve, no matter how big or small it might be, these are some of the steps you should take to make them more achievable. Break your overall goal into smaller goals that can be achieved in a specific amount of time. For your smaller goals you should know the who, what, when, where, why, and how. This is also a mnemonic that can also help you with goal setting. Just remember the word SMART. S is for specific, M is for measurable, A is for achievable, R is for relevant, and lastly T is for time. If your overall goal meets all this criteria then it’s definitely a smart goal. Also when you’re making goals that you’re able to track your progress.</center>

  <h3>
    <p>When you look in the mirror, point out things you love about yourself, even if they seem small or insignificant and reframe your “flaws” as benefits. For those of you that seems very self conscious about your weight, we want you to realize that it’s a very small detail in comparison to everything else. If you feel anxious or horrible when looking at scale just throw it away. Your weight is not what defines you because even if you’re not the weight you want to be, you are still capable of doing many things.
